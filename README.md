# MANGAD

https://mangad.herokuapp.com/

## Purpose

MANGAD is a manga themed image sharing website. Anyone may upload and view images in miniature form. In order to view images in high resolution, edit (the title or URL), or delete images, a user must login.

MANGAD does not solve any particular problem, it simply fills a niche that may not be quite covered by other image sharing sites such as Tumblr or Imgur, as it is particularly themed for manga.
