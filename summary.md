Mangad! is a photo album application which allows users to create accounts, link images, and create albums which contain those images. Preferably, they would use images from manga, but anything will be accepted. Users can sign in and sign out. Users also have unique pages which display their photo albums. A bonus feature for this site would be allowing users to view the albums of other users, and make comments on those albums. Another bonus feature could be the ability to tag images / albums, and have people search for individual photos / albums based on the tag.
