# What do I need

## Essentials

- Check for CRUD
- Make it so the EDIT function is specific to authors, not viewing individual images
- check issues from Zakk on GH

- Deploy this site on GH pages, not snail-speed heroku

## Bonus
- comments on images
- users can upload images
- users can tag images
- search based on tag
